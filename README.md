# Functional Programming Practice
This repository includes array, collection, object and other example manupulations using functional programming practices. Most of the excercises were mentioned [here]https://gist.github.com/oskarkv/3168ea3f8d7530ccd94c97c19aafe266

## Getting Started
To clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ansaries/fp.git
```
Then run
```
npm install
```
I have used **parcel** for packaging and hot reload, so to run it use
```
parcel ./src/index.html
```
or just type in your console
```
npm start
```


##Heads Up
Its personal level excercise, I tried to use vanilla to show values on Browser in a very weired manner.
Just use it for inspiration, all methods and examples are not recommended for production.
